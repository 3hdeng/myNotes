Install Node.js

http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.35/x64/node-v0.10.35-x64.msi

node --version
npm --version


$ npm install
Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\eltonden\AppData\Roaming\npm'

--> 
Manually creating a folder named 'npm' in the displayed path fixed the problem.

npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@0.3.1
...




--> The issue was resolved after running the command prompt as an administrator

--> 
npm install npm -g
The process of doing that will setup all the required directories.

-->
Install a stable version instead of the latest one, I have downgrade my version to node-v0.10.29-x86.msi from 'node-v0.10.33-x86.msi' and it is working well for me!
