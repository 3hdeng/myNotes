Installing from sources

When installing from source you will build a pip wheel that you then install using pip. You'll need pip for that, so install it as described above.

Clone the TensorFlow repository

$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
Note that these instructions will install the latest master branch of tensorflow. If you want to install a specific branch (such as a release branch), pass -b <branchname> to the git clone command and --recurse-submodules for r0.8 and earlier to fetch the protobuf library that TensorFlow depends on.

Installation for Linux

Install Bazel

Follow instructions here to install the dependencies for bazel. Then download the latest stable bazel version using the installer for your system and run the installer as mentioned there:

$ chmod +x PATH_TO_INSTALL.SH
$ ./PATH_TO_INSTALL.SH --user
Remember to replace PATH_TO_INSTALL.SH with the location where you downloaded the installer.

Finally, follow the instructions in that script to place bazel into your binary path.

Install other dependencies

# For Python 2.7:
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev python-wheel
# For Python 3.x:
$ sudo apt-get install python3-numpy swig python3-dev python3-wheel
Configure the installation

Run the configure script at the root of the tree. The configure script asks you for the path to your python interpreter and allows (optional) configuration of the CUDA libraries (see below).

This step is used to locate the python and numpy header files.

$ ./configure
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]:
Optional: Install CUDA (GPUs on Linux)

In order to build or run TensorFlow with GPU support, both NVIDIA's Cuda Toolkit (>= 7.0) and cuDNN (>= v2) need to be installed.
