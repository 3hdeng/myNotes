[Q] what's the meaning of tracking remote branch?

//=== http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5697750/what-exactly-does-the-u-do-git-push-u-origin-master-vs-git-push-origin-ma
 
from kernel.org for git push:

-u === --set-upstream

For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. For more information, see branch.<name>.merge in git-config(1).


//===
To see the difference, let's use a new empty branch:

$ git checkout -b test
First, we push without -u:

$ git push origin test
$ git pull
You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.test.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.

If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:

    [branch "test"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>

    [remote "<nickname>"]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>

See git-config(1) for details.
Now if we add -u:

$ git push -u origin test
Branch test set up to track remote branch test from origin.
Everything up-to-date
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.



//===
 git push -u origin master
Is the same as:

 git push origin master ; git branch --set-upstream master origin/master




//===
how to make a new branch that tracks remote branches, 
but how do I make an existing branch track a remote branch?

Set up the 'remote' if you don't have it already

# git remote add origin ssh://...
Now configure master to know to track:

# git config branch.master.remote origin
# git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
And push:

# git push origin master


//=== http://stackoverflow.com/questions/520650/make-an-existing-git-branch-track-a-remote-branch/2286030#2286030
$ git push -u origin branch-name

The git-branch command also understands --set-upstream, but its use can be confusing.
Version 1.8.0 modifies the interface.

git branch --set-upstream is deprecated and may be removed in a relatively distant future.  git branch [-u|--set-upstream-to] has been introduced with a saner order of arguments.
