'dd' to delete a cell
[Q] how to run ipython notebook cells at one time?
[Q] how to run a whole ipython notebook instead of an indivisual cell?

i'm using Notebook 0.13. Could you add keyboard shortcuts for

Print View
Run All

Unfortunately, this has become extremely tedious in the new interface:

(1) hunt for Restart in Kernel
(2) go to the last entry in Cell, select a submenu, clear all output
(3) go to the Cell menu again and select Run All

//=== interrupt / restart
At certain moments, it may be necessary to interrupt a calculation which is taking too long to complete. 
This may be done with the Kernel | Interrupt menu option, 
or 
Ctrl-m i keyboard shortcut. 

to restart the whole computational process, with the
Kernel | Restart menu option 
or 
Ctrl-m . shortcut.

The %%writefile magic is a very useful tool that writes the cell contents as a named file:

In [8]:
%%writefile foo.py
print('Hello world')
Writing foo.py

In [9]:
%run foo
Hello world



//===
Magics for running code under other interpreters
IPython has a %%script cell magic, which lets you run a cell in a subprocess of any interpreter on your system, such as: bash, ruby, perl, zsh, R, etc.

In [10]:
%%script python
import sys
print 'hello from Python %s' % sys.version
hello from Python 2.7.2 (default, Oct 11 2012, 20:14:37) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)]

In [11]:
%%script python3
import sys
print('hello from Python: %s' % sys.version)
hello from Python: 3.3.1 (v3.3.1:d9893d13c628, Apr  6 2013, 11:07:11) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)]



hese are all equivalent to %%script <name>

In [12]:
%%ruby
puts "Hello from Ruby #{RUBY_VERSION}"
Hello from Ruby 1.9.3

In [13]:
%%bash
echo "hello from $BASH"
hello from /usr/local/bin/bash
