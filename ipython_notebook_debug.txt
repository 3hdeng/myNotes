The most exciting announcement of this fresh preview and the whole upcoming release of PyCharm 4 is that the IPython notebook functionality is now fully supported in PyCharm!
It has been one of the most top voted feature requests in PyCharm’s public tracker for quite a long time and now we’re proud to introduce this brand new integration to you.

Note that the IPython Notebook integration is available in both PyCharm Community Edition and PyCharm Professional Edition.

Another great feature of the second PyCharm 4 preview build is that Pycharm’s debugger can now attach to a process!
