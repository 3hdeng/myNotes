Using parameters in batch files at DOS command line

 parameters passed through the command line can be accessed in batch files with the notation %1 to %9. There are also two other tokens that you can use:

%0 is the executable (batch file) name as specified in the command line.
%* is all parameters specified in the command line -- this is very useful if you want to forward the parameters to another program.

 Example: 
inside batch: 
   for %%d in (*) do echo %%d 

from command line:
   for %d in (*) do echo %d –  Steve Midgley Jan 16 '13 at 17:08 


FOR %%A IN (%*) DO (
    REM Now your batch file handles %%A instead of %1
    REM No need to use SHIFT anymore.
    ECHO %%A
)
