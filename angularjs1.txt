git clone --depth=14 https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git

*** The --depth=14 option just tells Git to pull down only the last 14 commits. This makes the download much smaller and faster.

cd angular-phonecat

Install Node.js

http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.35/x64/node-v0.10.35-x64.msi

node --version
npm --version


$ npm install
Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\eltonden\AppData\Roaming\npm'

--> 
Manually creating a folder named 'npm' in the displayed path fixed the problem.

npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@0.3.1
...




--> The issue was resolved after running the command prompt as an administrator

--> 
npm install npm -g
The process of doing that will setup all the required directories.

-->
Install a stable version instead of the latest one, I have downgrade my version to node-v0.10.29-x86.msi from 'node-v0.10.33-x86.msi' and it is working well for me!




//===
npm start : start a local development web-server
npm test : start the Karma unit test runner
npm run protractor : run the Protractor end to end (E2E) tests
npm run update-webdriver : install the drivers needed by Protractor



//===
 a set of drivers to allow it to interact with the browser. You can install these drivers by running:

npm run update-webdriver
(You should only need to do this once.)

Since Protractor works by interacting with a running application, we need to start our web server:

npm start
Then in a separate terminal/command line window, we can run the Protractor test scripts against the application by running:

npm run protractor
