//=== Install ffmpeg in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

http://askubuntu.com/questions/426543/install-ffmpeg-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts

sudo apt-get install libav-tools
or

sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
But then I realize it is not the correct version since it doesn't support for -filter_complex and few other functions.

After a few hours researcher I found real ffmpeg and I succeed with video conversion as well. As per that article, it is suggesting we need to build it our own.
