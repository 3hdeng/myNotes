The variable c stands for 'continuation', and 
cc for 'current continuation' â€• 
that last variable is used to store the function to continue with, when yielding a value to the outside world. 

Every time control leaves this function, it has to make sure that cc is set to a suitable value, 
which is what yield and stop take care of.
