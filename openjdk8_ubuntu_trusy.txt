openjdk 8 for ubuntu trusty(14.04)

As of 2016-04-23 Ubuntu 16.04 has ben released, with both OpenJDK 8 and 9 in the official repositories. I would recommend upgrading to that.

As of 2016-01-11 OpenJDK 8 is still not available in an official backport for 14.04. It is, however, available in 14.10 and forwards.

IMPORTANT: If you need this backported to 14.04, vote for this bug by logging in and clicking "Does it affect you" at the top: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-8/+bug/1368094

Java 8 is now available according to http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/, but http://openjdk.java.net/install/ does not yet mention how to install OpenJDK 8 (not Oracle Java) on Ubuntu 14.04 Long Term Support. (For 14.10 and later just run apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk)

How and when can this be done?


//=== openjdk8 for ubuntu14.04
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config javac
