--web-security=[true|false] enables web security and forbids cross-domain XHR (default is true). Also accepted: [yes|no].
--webdriver starts in 'Remote WebDriver mode' (embedded GhostDriver): '[[:]]' (default '127.0.0.1:8910')
--webdriver-selenium-grid-hub URL to the Selenium Grid HUB: 'URLTOHUB' (default 'none') (NOTE: works only together with '--webdriver')
--load-images=[true|false]


//=== http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21611434/what-exactly-does-the-phantomjs-option-web-security-false-turn-off
It is affecting at least cross-domain XHR checks, and HTTPS SSL certificate checks (i.e it will accept self-signed and expired certificates).

To be more precise, the option just enables the Qt WebKit WebSecurityEnabled option, and that in turn just enables the webkit security checks. Poking around the source I think it might also enable access to file:// URLs, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
