ipython is somewhat like the conventional Basic ?

IPython isn't a different programming language, it's just a set of 
computer programs for working with the Python language.

IPython Notebook : seamless integration of text and code
IPython Notebook as a research notebook



//=== markdown cell
In IPython this is accomplished by marking up text with the Markdown language. The corresponding cells are called Markdown cells. The Markdown language provides a simple way to perform this text markup, that is, to specify which parts of the text should be emphasized (italics), bold, form lists, etc.


Heading cells
You can provide a conceptual structure for your computational document as a whole using different levels of headings; there are 6 levels available, from level 1 (top level) down to level 6 (paragraph). These can be used later for constructing tables of contents, etc. As with Markdown cells, a heading cell is replaced by a rich text rendering of the heading when the cell is executed.

[Q] how to stop ipython notebook?
how to close IPython Notebook properly?

Currently, I just close the browser tabs and then use Ctrl+C in the terminal.
Unfortunately, neither exit() nor ticking Kill kernel upon exit does help (they do kill the kernel they but don't exit the iPython).


try killing the pythonw process from the Task Manager (if Windows) if nothing else works.

-->after closing chrome browser, 
the kernel is shutdown auto,
and then ctl+c does not work , nor other keys function,
the whole terminal console is frozen!

[Q] how to view the plot result in noteboook?

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Part%203%20-%20Plotting%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb
matplotlib mode
To make plots using Matplotlib, you must first enable IPython's matplotlib mode.
%matplotlib inline
--> use the inline backend, which will embed plots inside the Notebook:



*** nbconvert and nbviewer
Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML (for example, for blog posts), reStructeredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide shows,
 via the nbconvert command.

In effect, nbviewer is simply nbconvert as a web service
