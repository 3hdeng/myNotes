conda install <pkg name>. If a conda package is not available in the Continuum
Analytics repository (there are many more available in the repository than are
included in the installer), you can check binstar.org to see if someone has uploaded
tthe conda package you are looking for.
In addition, you can always install a package by the usual means, e.g. pip install,
or from source using a setup.py file
