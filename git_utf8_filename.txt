MSYS programs don't fully support Unicode yet, 
e.g. bash doesn't let you type non-ASCII characters
ls converts non-ASCII characters to '?' when printing to the console (redirecting to a file or another program works, though)

Tcl only supports BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane, i.e. Unicode characters \u0000 - \uffff), therefore gitk and git-gui currently don't support e.g. CJK Extensions B - D.


*** Checking if a repository contains non-ASCII file names

The recodetree check command scans the entire history of a git repository and prints all non-ASCII file names. If the output is empty, no migration is necessary.

Note: the recodetree script doesn't work with quoted characters, disable quoted file names first: git config [--global] core.quotepath off


*** Migration without previous Git for Windows available

Manually

This requires renaming all non-ASCII file names manually.

Check out a clean state of the working copy:
git clean -f && git reset --hard
git status will report non-ASCII file names as untracked (mostly with mangled names).
Fix the mangled file names in the working copy manually.
Replace file names in the staging area with the current state of the working copy:
git rm -rf --cached \* && git add --all
git status should now report all non-ASCII file names as renamed only.
Commit the changes:
git commit -m "UTF-8 conversion"
Repeat for every branch of interest
