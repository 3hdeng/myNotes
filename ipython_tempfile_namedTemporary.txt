IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'c:\\users\\eltonden\\appdata\\local\\temp\\tmpfgv_n5.txt'

File objects (be they temporary or otherwise) cannot be read multiple times without re-positioning the file position back to the start.

Your options are:

To reopen the file multiple times, creating multiple file objects for the same file.
To rewind the file object before each read.

pass delete=False to the constructor, especially on Windows, to be able to do this.

To rewind, call .seek(0) on the file object.

--> Set delete=False when creating the NamedTemporaryFile

 by default the temporary file is deleted as soon as it is closed. To fix this use:

tf = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)


import tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as temp:
    temp.write('Some data')
    temp.flush()




--> error

animation save gets error writing to file with ffmpeg and ogv (or ogg) #2764


-->
explicitly set the save writer to be FFmpegFileWriter() as suggest here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16721486/467314

 it depends on the used DPI when you save. This is the list of working DPIs (checked range(50, 501, 1))
