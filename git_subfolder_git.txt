??? Committing a git repository that contains another git repository throws an exception.

Maybe some error like, "A git repository was found in a subdirectory. Git repositories cannot be nested.".


So far, I have only used git from a gui (specifically github for Windows). 
I don't know what "git.git" is. 
??? However, duplicating the error should be easy. 
Clone any repository. Clone any other repository. Copy the second repository into a subdirectory of the first, and run any test you wish.
warm regards,
Blake


-->  a part of libgit2(sharp) seeing the submodule, which can only be a leaf and is thus treated as a file, and trying to add it as a file, which (presumably) git_index_add(_bypath)() doesn't like.
git won't show an error, 
since it's not an error to add a submodule (COMMIT). 
The resulting entry in the tree will however be likely rather unusable 
if you have not set up the submodule information. 
We shouldn't throw an error either.



--> 
This might be a bug in libgit2(sharp), in GHfW, or a combination or something else.
