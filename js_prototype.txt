javascript prototype tutorial

JavaScript Prototypes
All JavaScript objects inherit the properties and methods from their prototype.


Objects created using an object literal, or with new Object(), inherit from a prototype called Object.prototype.

Objects created with new Date() inherit the Date.prototype

The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype chain.

All JavaScript objects (Date, Array, RegExp, Function, ....) inherit from the Object.prototype.


//=== constructor function
function person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");


Adding a new property to an existing object is easy:
[Example]
myFather.nationality = "English";


You cannot add a new property to a prototype the same way as you add a new property to an existing object, because the prototype is not an existing object.

[Example]
xxx person.nationality = "English"; xxx

-->
Using the prototype Property
The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to an existing prototype:

[example]
person.prototype.nationality = "English";
